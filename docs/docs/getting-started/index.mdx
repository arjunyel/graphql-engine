# Getting Started

## Introduction

To use the Hasura GraphQL Engine, you'll need to:

- Deploy the Hasura GraphQL engine with access to a Postgres database to store its metadata.
- Connect new/existing database(s) and set up and test your GraphQL API using the Hasura console UI (also possible via
  CLI or API).
- Consume the generated GraphQL API from your client apps.

You have a couple of options when getting started.

### Hasura Cloud <HeadingIcon icon={`cloud`} size={24} />

[Hasura Cloud](https://cloud.hasura.io) is the preferred choice when getting started. Hasura Cloud is a hosted service
for Hasura GraphQL Engine projects with added features for reliability and security. If you're looking for the least
friction between trying out Hasura and moving into production,
[check out this quickstart guide](/getting-started/getting-started-cloud.mdx) and **get started for free**.

### Docker Compose

If you'd like to get a local version up and running fast, [check out our quickstart using Docker Compose](/getting-started/docker-simple.mdx). At its heart, Hasura is open-source, and within minutes you'll have a fully functional Hasura GraphQL Engine instance running locally to experiment. If you want to learn more about Hasura GraphQL Engine's core features and see if it's right
for you, consider this option.

### Local Development with Docker Compose

[Hasura Migrations and Metadata](/migrations-metadata-seeds/index.mdx) allow you to keep track of, update, roll back, or move
your database and Hasura Server configurations using the [Hasura CLI](/hasura-cli/index.mdx). Combined with Docker Compose, the [local development quickstart](/getting-started/docker-local.mdx) lets you track changes in version control and deploy anywhere.

### Supported databases

Regardless of which option you choose, Hasura GraphQL Engine supports:

- [Postgres](/databases/postgres/index.mdx)
- [MS SQL Server](/databases/ms-sql-server/index.mdx)
- [Citus / Hyperscale](/databases/postgres/citus-hyperscale-postgres/index.mdx)
- [BigQuery](/databases/bigquery/index.mdx)
- **MySQL** (in preview) - See the [preview guide](/guides/mysql-preview.mdx)
