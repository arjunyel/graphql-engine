# Quickstart with Local Development

## Introduction

This guide will help you set up local development with [Migrations, Metadata](/migrations-metadata-seeds/index.mdx), and Docker Compose. Then we can easily keep track of, update, roll back, or move
your database and Hasura Server configurations using the [Hasura CLI](/hasura-cli/index.mdx).

## Prerequisites

- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/install/)
- [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)
- [Hasura CLI](/hasura-cli/index.mdx)

## Step 1: Get the docker-compose file

The [hasura/graphql-engine/install-manifests](https://github.com/hasura/graphql-engine/tree/stable/install-manifests)
repo contains all installation manifests required to deploy Hasura anywhere. Get the Docker Compose file from there:

```bash
# in a new directory run
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hasura/graphql-engine/stable/install-manifests/docker-compose-local/docker-compose.yaml
# or run
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hasura/graphql-engine/stable/install-manifests/docker-compose-local/docker-compose.yaml -o docker-compose.yml
```

We are using [the `cli-migrations` image](/migrations-metadata-seeds/auto-apply-migrations.mdx), which automatically applies migrations and metadata.

## Step 2: Create Migrations and Metadata Folder

Use the Hasura CLI to [initialize the Migrations and Metadata folder](/hasura-cli/commands/hasura_init.mdx). For this example, we will name the folder `hasura`. If you use a different name, make sure to update the `docker-compose.yaml` volumes.

```bash
hasura init hasura
```

## Step 2: Run Hasura GraphQL Engine

The following command will run Hasura GraphQL engine along with a Postgres database to store its metadata.

```bash
$ docker-compose up -d
```

Check if the containers are running:

```bash
$ docker ps

CONTAINER ID IMAGE                 ... CREATED STATUS PORTS          ...
097f58433a2b hasura/graphql-engine ... 1m ago  Up 1m  8080->8080/tcp ...
b0b1aac0508d postgres              ... 1m ago  Up 1m  5432/tcp       ...
```

## Step 3: Connect a database

Run the [Hasura console](/hasura-cli/commands/hasura_console.mdx)

```bash
hasura console --project hasura
```

Head to `http://localhost:8080/console` to open the Hasura console.

Navigate to `Data -> Manage -> Connect Database`:

Name the database default and connect via the `PG_DATABASE_URL` environment variable.

## Step 4: Try out Hasura

### Create a table

On the Hasura console, navigate to `Data -> Create table` and create a sample table called `profiles` with the following
columns:

```sql
profiles (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY, -- serial -> auto-incrementing integer
  name TEXT
)
```

<Thumbnail
  src="/img/getting-started/create-profile-table.png"
  alt="Create a table"
  width="1200px"
/>

In your `hasura` folder, you can see the new metadata and generated SQL migration.

Now, insert some sample data into the table using the `Insert Row` tab of the `profiles` table.

### Try out a query

Head to the `API` tab in the console and try running the following query:

```graphql
query {
  profiles {
    id
    name
  }
}
```

You'll see that you get all the inserted data!

  src="/img/getting-started/profile-query.png"
  alt="Try out a query"
  width="1200px"
/>

### Deploy

Now you can apply the migrations and metadata to any Hasura instance. For example, to sync with [Hasura Cloud](https://cloud.hasura.io/signup/?pg=docs&plcmt=body&cta=navigate-to-cloud-hasura-io&tech=default) you can use the [Github integration](/deployment/github-integration.mdx) or the Hasura CLI:

```bash
hasura migrate apply --project hasura --database-name default --endpoint <Hasura Cloud endpoint> --admin-secret <secret>
hasura metadata apply --project hasura --database-name default --endpoint <Hasura Cloud endpoint> --admin-secret <secret>
```

### Learn course

For a full hands-on tour of Hasura, check out our
[30-Minute Hasura Basics Course](https://hasura.io/learn/graphql/hasura/introduction/).

### Stay up to date

We release new features every month. Sign up for our newsletter by using the link below. We send newsletters only once a
month. <https://hasura.io/newsletter/>.

### Database operations

- [Database modeling](/schema/postgres/index.mdx): Learn how to model your database schema, as well as how to extend
  it.
- [Querying data](/queries/postgres/index.mdx): Use GraphQL queries to query data from your GraphQL API.
- [Inserting data](/mutations/postgres/index.mdx): Use GraphQL mutations to insert data into your GraphQL API.

### Business logic

Depending on your use case, there are several options for implementing business logic.

- [Actions](/actions/index.mdx): Actions can be used if you'd like to extend your GraphQL schema by integrating with a
  REST endpoint.
- [Remote schemas](/remote-schemas/index.mdx): If you have an existing GraphQL server or if you're comfortable with
  implementing one, you can use remote schemas.
- [Event triggers](/event-triggers/index.mdx): To trigger a serverless function based on a database event, use event
  triggers.
- [Scheduled triggers](/scheduled-triggers/index.mdx): Scheduled triggers are used to execute custom business logic at
  specific points in time.

### Secure your endpoint

[Add an admin secret](/deployment/deployment-guides/docker.mdx#docker-secure) to make sure that your GraphQL endpoint
and the Hasura console are not publicly accessible.
