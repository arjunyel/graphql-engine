# Test

## Useful resources

- [Cypress Dashboard for the Console project](https://dashboard.cypress.io/projects/5yiuic)

## Writing Tests

- Read ups

  - If this is your first time with cypress, check out this getting started [guide](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/getting-started/writing-your-first-test.html)

  - Read cypress [best practices](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/references/best-practices.html)

- File Structure

  The top-level directories in [console/cypress](../../console/cypress) are auto-generated by cypress except [helpers](../../console/cypress/helpers). To understand the use of each directory check out [Folder Structure](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/core-concepts/writing-and-organizing-tests.html#Folder-Structure)

  [helpers](../../console/cypress/helpers) directory is used for sharing reusable functions/constants across tests. Before adding a resubale function in this directory, consider if it will be better as a custom cypress command, if so, then add it to [Support](../../console/cypress/support) directory following this [guide](https://docs.cypress.io/api/cypress-api/custom-commands.html), preferrably to [command.ts](../../console/cypress/support/commands.ts) file.

- Adding a Test

  Tests go to [integration](../../console/cypress/integration) directory, where there are folders corresponding to Components in [Services](../../console/src/components/Services) directory (The top-level routes on the console).

  Each of these folders contains different test folders, named after the particular feature they are testing. For example [create-table](../../console/cypress/integration/data/create-table) folder tests the functionality of creating a table from the console UI.
